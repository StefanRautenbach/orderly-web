## Blackbox tests for OrderlyWeb

These should be used sparingly as they are somewhat time consuming to run. For most purposes 
the integration tests in `app/src/test` suffice to test API functionality, but in some instances 
we want end to end tests where we bring up the OrderlyWeb container to run tests against.

These don't really need to be written in Kotlin or to live in this repo! Maybe we should move them
 to the deploy tool.

### Running locally 
To run locally you must first have a local copy of the app image versioned to the same commit that
is checked out. This can be generated by making sure `git status` is clean and then running

    ./scripts/generate-test-data.sh

followed by
 
    ./scripts/build-app.sh
    
Then the tests can be run through the IDE as usual.

### Teamcity
On Teamcity these tests are run in a docker container. The script `./run-blackbox-tests.sh`
dockerises and then runs the tests. This step only happens after `./scripts/build-app.sh` 
has run successfully.
